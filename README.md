**Reduce stress and anxiety with beautiful, customizable breathing exercises.**

This project offers a visually engaging way to learn and practice mindful breathing. Whether you're new to meditation or a seasoned practitioner, our visualizer can help you find a sense of calm and focus.


## What's in it for you?

*   **Variety of Breathing Exercises:** Explore techniques like box breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, 4-7-8 breathing, and alternate nostril breathing.
*   **Mesmerizing Animations:**  Choose from calming geometric patterns, serene nature scenes, and more to guide your breath.
*   **Customize Your Experience:**  Adjust the breathing pace, session duration, animation style, and colors to create a practice that perfectly suits your needs.

## For Developers

This project is designed to be flexible and integrate with various technologies:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Pure JavaScript:** A simple JavaScript API for creating and controlling animations. [See documentation](link-to-js-docs)
    *   **Web Components:** Encapsulated components for use in any framework. [See examples](link-to-web-component-examples)
    *   **React Component:**  [See npm package](link-to-react-npm)
    *   **Vue Component:** [See npm package](link-to-vue-npm)
    *   **Angular Component:** [See npm package](link-to-angular-npm)
*   **Backend/Other:**
    *   **C++:**  C++ library for integrating breathing visualizations into native applications or embedded systems. [See examples](link-to-cpp-examples)
    *   **WebAssembly:**  WASM module for high-performance animations in web and non-web environments. [See documentation](link-to-wasm-docs)
    *   **GoLang:** Go package for building breathing visualization applications in Go. [See documentation](link-to-golang-docs)

## Backed by Science

Our project is informed by scientific research on the benefits of mindful breathing for stress and anxiety reduction. A comprehensive review of 58 clinical studies, published in the journal *Brain Sciences*, found that breathing practices can be incredibly effective in reducing stress and anxiety when done correctly [1]. 

**Here's what the science says about creating an effective breathing practice:**

*   Avoid breathing exercises that only involve fast breathing.
*   Practice for at least 5 minutes per session.
*   Include some form of instruction or guidance, especially when you're first learning.
*   Make it a regular habit - practice multiple times and over a longer period for optimal benefits.

**We're incorporating these findings into our project to help you maximize the benefits of mindful breathing.**
